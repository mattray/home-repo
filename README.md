# Migrating from Hosted Chef to internal Chef Infra Server on `ndnd`.
The `mattray::migrate` recipe handles most of the heavy lifting.
Bring over the ndnd SSL cert and the chef_managed_org-validator.pem
Move the client.pem out of the way
Change the /etc/chef/client.rb and it will fail the run, then succeed against the new host on the next run.
